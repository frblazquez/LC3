## Abastract:
LC3 stands for Limestone Calcined Clay Cement, it is the newest type of cement that offers an alternative for environmental sustainability, it is made with calcined clay, this material can be found in abundance, it is an ecological cement that contains less clinker and uses less fuel in its production, therefore reducing CO2 emissions by up to 30\%.

## Architecture of the directory
In the repository you will find a folder called data, which contains two files, one with all the compressive strength measurements made using different clays and the characteristics of these clays (data_full) and the other with the averages and standard deviation of the compressive strength, together with the characteristics of the clays(data_merged). You will also find three notebooks that show all the work done, and a .py file that contains the functions used in those notebooks. 
* Data 
  -data_merged 
  -data_full 
* lc3_full_data.ipynb. It shows the work carried out taking into account all the measurements made by the laboratory
* lc3_merged_data.ipynb. It shows the work done from the averages of the measurements of the compressive strength
* lc3_modelling_with_std.ipynb. Shows the work done from the standard deviations of the measurements of the compressive strength
* lc3_implementations.py. Contains all the functions used in notebooks

## To reproduce the results. 
Once the repository has been downloaded, you can run the notebook cells and see the results.
