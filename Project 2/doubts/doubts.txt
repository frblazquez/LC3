// DOUBTS ABOUT THE PROJECT:
    
1.- OPC measurements were also repeated three times? Is it normal those big stds?
    (view second excel)
2.- B45  Quartz B250 really has 0% Kaolinite content?
    (Quartz is "cuarzo", has almost everything SiO2)
3.- Lakshmi2 really has std 0?
    (yes, check in second excel)


4.- When reading excel, how are missing values, 0 and - entries going to be handled?
5.- When reading excel, do we have to replace ',' by '.' in floating points?
