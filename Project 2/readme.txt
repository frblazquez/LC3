Hello Franco, 

This folder contains the final version of the resources involved in our project:

-> data/ -------> As we have used it, organized and prepared to be read with a computer      
-> code/ -------> Jupyter notebooks and a auxiliar .py with implementations (for developers)
-> notebooks/ --> The notebooks exported to .html so you can see them without installing Jupyter
-> report/ -----> Latex source code for the report (oriented for the ML course)
-> images/ -----> Confidence intervals images in .png format
-> LC3.pdf -----> The report explaining the data analysis process (last page done with the water up to the neck)

Anything else you need don't hesitate to write us! We hope it's useful. 

Once again thank you very much!
Andr√©s, David and Francis
